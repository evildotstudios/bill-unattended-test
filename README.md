# Bill unattended test

## Premise
The major intent is to build a small app that fetches and shows a Sky bill. Also the objective is to show a simple and clean solution, with TDD usage. 


## Installation
I've included the vendor directory in the repo (usually I don't) to make it easier to make it run


1. clone the code to any web directory 
3. open in browser


# Testing
Tests can be run at the root of the cloned solution with the command:

./vendor/bin/phpunit SanitizeTest.php

Like I've told in the previous interview, I've never used unit testing in depth but it is a demonstrable test
